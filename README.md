# DAVe

**DAVe** is **D**ata **A**nalytics and **V**isualisation S**e**rvice. It is free open source client which connects to [Eurex Clearing Enhanced Risk Interface](http://www.eurexclearing.com/clearing-en/risk-management/system-based-risk-controls/post-trade-risk-control/enhanced-risk-interface) AMQP interface (ERS). It provides a UI and REST interface to access latest as well as historical data data received over ERS.

## Build
    mvn clean package

The shippable artifact will be built in `target/dave-VERSION` directory.

## Configure

Configuration is stored in `dave.json` file in JSON format. Configuration is split into several sections:

### ERS

The `ers` section configures the Enhanced Risk Solution connection. It is an array which might contain several JSON objects - each object representing one ERS connection.

| Option | Explanation | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `brokerHost` | ERS broker hostname | `localhost.de` |
| `brokerPort` | ERS broker port | `18080` |
| `member` | Member ID which will be used for the ERS connection | `ABCFR` |
| `truststore` | JKS file with the public key of the ERS broker |  |
| `truststorePassword` | Password to the JKS file containing the public key |  |
| `keystore` | JKS file with the private key |  |
| `keystorePassword` | Password to the JKS file containing the private key |  |
| `sslCertAlias` | Alias of the private key which should be used for the connection |  |
| `connectionPoolSize` | Defines the pool size of the connection factory | `10` |

### MongoDB

The `mongodb` section contains the configuration of the MongoDB database where will the ERS data be persisted.

| Option | Explanation | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `dbName` | Name of the database which will be used | `DAVe` |
| `connectionUrl` | Connection URL to connect to the database | `mongodb://localhost:27017` |

### HTTP

The `http` section configures the web based UI and the REST API.

| Option | Explanation | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `httpPort` | Port of the HTTP server | `8080` |
| `compression` | Enbale gzip compression of the HTTP responses | `true` |
| `ssl` | Subsection configuring SSL/TLS on the webserver |  |
| `CORS` | Subsection configuring Cross-origin resource sharing (see below) |  |
| `CSRF` | Subsection configuring Cross-site request forgery protection (see below) |  |
| `auth` | Subsection configuring authentication (see below) |  |


### SSL

The `ssl` section configures the SSL/TLS support in the webserver.

| Option | Explanation | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `enable` | Enable HTTPS protocol | `true` |
| `httpsPort` | Port of the HTTSP server | `8181` |
| `redirectHttp` | Redirect HTTP connections to HTTPS | `true` |
| `redirectUri` | URI where the HTTP requests will be redirected. The URI should not contain the protocol and optionally might contain the port. | `ssl.mydomain.com` |
| `keystore` | JKS file with the private key |  |
| `keystorePassword` | Password to the JKS file containing the private key |  |
| `truststore` | JKS file with trusted client CAs |  |
| `truststorePassword` | Password to the JKS file containing the trusted certificates |  |
| `requireTLSClientAuth` | Sets TLS client authentication as required | `false` |

#### Auth

The `auth` subsection configures authentication to the UI and REST interface. The Mongo databases configured from authentication can be different database from the one configured for storing ERS data.

| Option | Explanation | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
<<<<<<< HEAD
| `enable` | Disables or enables authetication | `true` |
| `dbName` | Name of the database which will be used | `DAVe` |
| `connectionUrl` | Connection URL to connect to the database | `mongodb://localhost:27017` |
| `jwtKeystorePath` | Path to the keystore (JCEKS type) required by JWT authentication provider | |
| `jwtKeystorePassword`| Password to the JWT keystore (JCEKS type) used by authentication provider | |
| `salt` | Salt string used in hashed passwords | `sdf8hdgss3_a` |
| `checkUserAgainstCertificate` | Validate username against the CN from the TLS client certificate subject. Unless the CN is equal to the username, authentication will be refused. _*)_ | `false` |

_*) This feature doesn't work properly with self-signed certificates, where the holder of the certificate can easily issue and sign another certificate which would contain different CN and login._

#### CORS

The `CORS` subsection configures Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), which allows the REST API to be used from web applications running under different domain.

| Option | Explanation | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `enable` | Enabled the CORS handler | `true` |
| `origin` | Configures the domain from which cross-origin access will be allowed | `http://mydomain.com` |

#### CSRF

The `CSRF` subsection configures Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection. When enabled, the handler will set a XSRF-TOKEN cookie and the client has to send back its value in the X-XSRF-TOKEN header. This handler weill be activated only when authentication is enabled.

| Option | Explanation | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `enable` | Enable the CSRF handler | `true` |
| `secret` | Configures the domain secret used to generate CSFR tokens | `61d77a85-276b-476a-8810-f8408b5cfa19` |

## Run

Use script `start_dave.sh|bat` to start the application depending on your operating system (Linux,MacOS | Windows).

## Run UI only

If you want to decouple UI from the back-end and assuming you have DAVe already running on some host (as described in the previous step) with CORS option enabled, you can deploy and work on UI part of the application on another machine than back-end is running.

On the host where the back-end should be started:
 - Modify configuration file to enable CORS (see section above).
 - Start DAVe using `start_dave.sh|bat` script.

On the host where the UI simple web server should be started:
 - Install [npm](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm) first
 - Install Grunt CLI using `npm install -g grunt-cli`. Use `sudo` on Linux or MacOS if necessary. You may need to setup http(s) proxy using:
   - `npm config set proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080`
   - `npm config set https-proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080`
 - `cd` into the directory where UI related files reside: `cd src/main/resources/webroot`.
 - Run `npm install` to download necessary packages.
 - Run `npm start` to start the simple web server and use the host/port written to the standard output in the browser.
 - Whenever there is a change to the files related to the UI, the server gets notified immediately - no restart is needed.
 - Point your UI to the host, where the back-end for DAVe is running - see `app.js` file, section `hostConfig`.

## Managing user database

Use script `user_manager.sh`. Script accepts one of the following commands:
  - `insert`
  - `delete`
  - `list`

### Insert new user record
      user_manager.sh insert USER PASSWORD

### Delete existing user record
      user_manager.sh delete USER

### List all user records
      user_manager.sh list
